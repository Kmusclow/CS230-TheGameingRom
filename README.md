Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

Our client is The Gaming Room  who is looking to develop a web-based game that will be able to operate on several platforms and will be based off the existing game they have created. The current game is only playable on Android devices so the client is looking for expansion into other platforms. We will ensure the customer will have a great customer expericnce across all platforms and ensure a seemless cross platform experience.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

For this project I beleive I did a good job at sticking to an orginal plan and making adjustments as needed. Prior attempts for different projects I would get stuck and chase my tail in circles until a answer came to me. THis time I stuck to what I knew and payed extra attention to the details. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design document helped me out a ton. I would refer to it often to ensure I was staying on task to provide The Gaming Room exactly what they were looking for.  Doing this allowed me to provide everything that they needed along with providing as much detail and information that I could. This design document is a great reference point while developing to refer back to. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one part of my work to revise I beleive I would have spend more time looking into the option of using Linux instead of Windows. The reason I choose windows is becasue I was comforatable with the platform  but I beleive Linux would have been a great option also. I struggled a bit with making calls for the client on exactly what they would need but overall using the design document has taught me alot for the future. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Since we knew that The Gaming Room wanted to be cross platform and based off the orginal Android game we had a decent starting point. It was very important that we had a user friendly expierance  and had cross play capabilities. I spend time to look indepth at the customers request to ensure that we provide exactly what they are looking for are looking for. Doing this allowed me to stick to the customers scope of work that they were looking for. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When I approched the designing the soft ware I took it on step by step instead of all at once. Doing this allowed me to ensure that I was able to complete all of the users needs. Breaking the project down into smaller parts, helps keep things more manageable and keeps things cleaner and more accurate. In the future I would use this same technique but I would allot myself a bit more time to provide better comments and keep things more uniform.
